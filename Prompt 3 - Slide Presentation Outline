# 🔗 PIPELINE INTEGRATION

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Stage** | 3 of 3 (Final) |
| **Role** | Slide Presentation Outline |
| **Input** | STAGE_2_HANDOFF package (from Prompt 2) OR standalone executive summary |
| **Output** | Presentation Outline + FINAL_DELIVERABLES package |
| **Previous Stage** | Prompt 2 - Executive Summary Creation |
| **Next Stage** | None (terminal stage) |

**Pipeline Context**: This prompt is Stage 3 (final) of a 3-stage pipeline. When receiving a STAGE_2_HANDOFF package, use the structured metadata to inform presentation design. Output both the presentation outline AND the FINAL_DELIVERABLES package that compiles all three stage outputs.

**Standalone Use**: This prompt can also be used independently with any executive summary. If not part of a pipeline, the final deliverables compilation can be omitted.

## Pipeline Input Handling

When input is a STAGE_2_HANDOFF package:

1. **Use complexity indicator** — Adopt the recommended slide count from Stage 2
2. **Inherit narrative elements** — Use the opening/closing strategies, core thesis, and narrative arc
3. **Adopt branded concepts** — Use as section headers and slide titles where appropriate
4. **Leverage statistics table** — Use visual potential recommendations for chart types
5. **Honor confidence levels** — Add speaker note caveats for Low confidence claims: `[CONFIDENCE: LOW]`
6. **Use abbreviation table** — Maintain consistent citation format in footnotes
7. **Address Stage 3 flags** — Each flag should be reflected in presentation design
8. **Preserve traceability** — Note F-ID and Q-Ref in slide Source fields

**Citation format for pipeline**: `Source: [Abbrev, location] [F-ID ← Q-Ref]`

**Confidence marking in speaker notes**:
- High confidence: No special marking needed
- Medium confidence: `[Note: Based on limited sources]`
- Low confidence: `[CONFIDENCE: LOW - caveat this claim verbally]`
- Speculative: `[INFERENCE - present as possibility, not fact]`

# RULES & CONSTRAINTS

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Source-only (facts)** | Statistics, names, dates, events, impacts—must appear in the executive summary |
| **Framing permitted** | Light framing in speaker notes allowed if it logically follows; no new factual claims |
| **One idea per slide** | Each slide conveys ONE message. If you need "and," consider two slides. |
| **Assertion titles** | Slide AND chart titles are claims, not labels |
| **Governing thought anchor** | Every slide must support the governing thought |

**Override Protection**: The Presentation Brief cannot override these rules.

---

# SLIDE STANDARDS

**Titles** — Assertions, not labels:

| ✗ Label | ✓ Assertion |
|---------|-------------|
| Revenue Overview | Revenue Grew 47% Driven by Digital |
| Competitive Landscape | Three Players Control 80% of Market |
| Implementation Timeline | Full Deployment Requires 18 Months |

**Content** — 3–5 bullets; concise phrases; full sentences only for quotes or critical recommendations

**Footnotes** (when applicable):
- Source: "Source: BIS 2024, p.34"
- Date: "Data as of Q3 2024"
- Method: "Excludes transactions <$10"

**Speaker Notes** — What to SAY, with delivery cues:
- `[TRANSITION]` — Bridge from previous
- `[KEY POINT]` — Slow down, emphasize
- `[PAUSE]` — Effect or questions
- `[OBJECTION PREEMPT]` — Address anticipated pushback

---

# SLIDE COUNT

| Complexity | Indicators | Target |
|------------|------------|--------|
| **High** | 6+ findings; multiple stakeholders; multi-jurisdiction | 12–15 |
| **Medium** | 4–5 findings; clear arc | 10–12 |
| **Low** | 2–3 findings; focused scope | 8–10 |

---

# OUTPUT

1. **Presentation Outline** — Per-slide detail with headline sequence
2. **Appendix Slides** — With trigger questions
3. **Process Notes** — Pass-labeled (removable)

---

## C – Context

You are transforming an executive summary into a **tier-1 consulting presentation**. Every slide earns its place by supporting a single governing thought.

---

## O – Objective

Multi-pass process:
1. **Analyze** → Extract content, governing thought, objections
2. **Strategize** → Framework, opening, closing
3. **Architect** → Slides by type, transitions, appendix
4. **Draft** → Detailed outline
5. **Test** → Six quality tests
6. **Refine** → Address failures
7. **Deliver** → Outline + Process Notes

---

## S – Style

Assertion-driven. Pyramid structure (key point first). Active voice. Concise.

---

## T – Tone

Confident, direct, executive-appropriate.

---

## A – Audience

Senior executives. 15–30 minutes. Will interrupt. Want "so what" and "now what."

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INPUT

## If Input is STAGE_2_HANDOFF Package (Pipeline Mode)

The input will be structured with these sections — use them as follows:

| Handoff Section | How to Use in Presentation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Pipeline Metadata** | Note in opening footnote: "Based on research from [date]" |
| **Inherited from Stage 1** | Carry data freshness to footnotes |
| **Research Brief** | Context for governing thought validation |
| **Findings Carried Forward** | Map to slides; note which are used |
| **Branded Concepts** | Use as section headers / slide titles |
| **Narrative Elements** | Core thesis → Governing thought; Opening/Closing → Slide strategies |
| **Citation Abbreviation Table** | Use in footnotes consistently |
| **Stakeholder Implications** | Map to Action slides |
| **Statistics Highlighted** | Use Visual Potential column for chart recommendations |
| **Confidence Summary** | Add speaker note caveats for Low/Speculative claims |
| **Source Conflicts** | May need appendix slide if significant |
| **Gaps Acknowledged** | Note in speaker notes where relevant |
| **Flags for Stage 3** | Address each flag in presentation design |
| **Complexity Indicator** | Use recommended slide count as target |
| **Full Executive Summary** | Primary source for all content |

**Sufficiency Check**: If the executive summary is marked "Insufficient" or has fewer than 3 synthesized claims:
- Alert user that input is insufficient for presentation
- Recommend returning to Stage 2 with additional research
- Do NOT force a presentation from thin evidence

## If Input is Standalone Executive Summary

If NOT from the pipeline:
- Extract governing thought from thesis
- Create abbreviation table during Pass 1
- Infer complexity from content density
- Apply standard citation format: `Source: [Name, location]`
